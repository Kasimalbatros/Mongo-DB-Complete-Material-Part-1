Complex Expressions In Mongo DB.
--------------------------------


The $expr operator in MongoDB allows you to use aggregation expressions within 
the query language. This is particularly useful when you need to compare fields within 
the same document.

Example: Using $expr to Compare Fields
Suppose you have a collection named employees, and each document has fields salary and expectedSalary. You want to find all employees whose actual salary is greater than their expected salary.

Hereâ€™s how you can use $expr:

=================================
db.employees.find({
  $expr: {
    $gt: ["$salary", "$expectedSalary"]
  }
})
Explanation:
$gt: This is the greater-than comparison operator.
"$salary" and "$expectedSalary": These are references to the fields in each document. The "$" symbol indicates that the value is taken from the document itself.
