Case Sensitivity in Mongo DB.
================================================

1. Collections names are case-sensitive.

2. Field names within documents are also-sensitive.



db.Product.insertOne({name:'thapa',age:30});        ---> 1st Query

db.product.insertOne({name:'thapa',age:30});         ---> 2nd Query


Both are Considered as Different in MongoDB.
